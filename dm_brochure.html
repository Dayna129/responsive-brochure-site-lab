        <p id="first_para"> Alexander Technique is the study of the possibility of who we each can be in any given moment outside of the habits and ideas that currently define us. It is the study of what else and who else is possible when we make space to set aside what is known and choose to playfully explore what is currently outside our awareness.</p>
        
        <p>Deferring to the innate design of our bodies, Alexander Technique works to explore possibilities with a student through a hands-on study of how we each move through the world doing what we do - driving a car, doing the dishes, walking, singing etc. The study is both practical and profound, creating new choices for each student as patterns of use are observed, explored, and transformed.</p>

        <p>Because our habitual patterns are often the source of our discomfort, pain, and imbalance, changes in these patterns through our awareness and choice are often accompanied by significant diminishment of our dis-ease, fostering a renewed sense of joy, freedom, and balance.</p>

        <p>In a lesson, a teacher observes in order to notice what might not be working the way that you want it to. With kindness and clarity a teacher witnesses you doing what is important to you - public speaking, yoga, playing the cello, etc.</p>

        <p>Whatever it is, by watching a teacher perceives what is interfering with what you want to do. It might be a subtle tightening, or holding your breath, or it might be an idea you have about how to do your task.</p>

        <p>The technique can improve conditions such as backache and other sorts of long-term pain that are often the result of misusing your body over a long period of time, such asÂ moving inefficiently and standing or sitting with your weight unevenly distributed.</p>

        <p>The aim of the Alexander technique is to help you "unlearn" these bad habits and achieve a balanced, more naturally aligned body. Pleasure, comfort, and ease return as you learn how to help yourself.</p>
